<h1>Building Agents</h1>
<p>Language agents are computer programs that can understand and respond to human language. They are used in a variety of applications, such as customer service chatbots, language translation, and natural language processing.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to build language agents. The most common approach is to use machine learning techniques. Machine learning algorithms can learn to map input text to output text, which allows them to generate natural-sounding responses to user queries.</p>
<p>In this section, we will cover the basics of building language agents. We will discuss the different types of machine learning algorithms that can be used, and we will provide you with tips for designing and training your own language agents.</p>
